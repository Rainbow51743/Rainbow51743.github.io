I have created this website as a way to share my portfolio without anyone needing to download and view a colossal file. This also allows me to share the variety of my work, from Rhino floorplans to watercolor paintings.
I created this website with a Github template (linked in the footer), a lot of research, and countless hours of hard work. It functions primarily on HTML, with some elements scripted in CSS and JavaScript. To navigate, you can click or tap on the links in the header to view my architecture, graphic design, and physical art. 
My contact information can be found at the footer of every page. Thank you for taking the time to view my work!
